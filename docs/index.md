# Welcome to Computer Vision with satellite Imagery and Data

This workshop/course aims to introduce Deep Learning for satellite imagery and geospatial data. The course focuses on hands-on computer labs that introduce concepts and methods used
in Deep Learning using python and tensorflow. Labs are designed to gradually increase the complexity of Deep Learning Neural Network architectures by exploring in succession Dense Neural Networks, Convolutional Networks and the encoder-decoder structure (U-net).
Example applications will include Land use/Land cover, image classification labeling and semantic segmentation. If time permits, we will also provide an example of hyperspectral image classification and/or transfer learning.'

The course has been offered every year since 2021 at the American Association of Geographer (AAG). It will be offered in 2024 at the AAG.
